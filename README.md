## Business understanding
In the telecommunications sector customer retention is a very sensitive role. There must be sincere monitoring of the customers behaviours constantly and establish their cause. Failure to which might lead to churning of customers due to different reasons. This not only leads to a considerable loss to  the stakeholders but also tarnishes the reputation of the company at large.SyriaTel, a Telecommunicatiions company , aims to improve their services through predictive modelling so as to prevent (or minimize) chances of future customer diversion from their services.I have been appointed for this
## Problem Statement
SyriaTel is in constant worry of whether the customer will churn or not. This problem has lead to them unable to make stable and precise decision on the customers that visit, additionally to maintain the already present customers
## Objectives
i) Create a model to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the companyâ€™s services. This will help the company     improve its ability to keep customers and stay competitive in the communications industry.

ii) Determine factors that have a higer effect on customer churning.

iii)Build different models to evaluate the best model.
## Obsevations
In this project, we focused on SyriaTel's data regarding customer churn. Customer churn has always negatively impacted the company's profits and reputation. Our task was to develop a predictive model using SyriaTel's customer churn records. This model helps determine the likelihood of a customer leaving, allowing the company to take steps to prevent churn by improving its services.

We analyzed the historical churn rate, customer communication behaviors, time spent on calls, amount spent, and active subscriptions.

All the models showed good performance, with the RandomForestClassifier achieving the highest accuracy of 87.17%.
## Recommendations
1. **Feedback Loop**: Regularly ask customers, especially those who left, why they decided to leave. Their answers can help the company improve its services and make better decisions.

2. **Timely Engagement**: Reach out to customers who are likely to leave with special offers, rewards, or support to solve their issues and improve their experience with the company.

3. **Personalized Customer Experience**: Use the information from the model to give customers a more personal experience. By understanding what they like and need, the company can offer products and services that better suit them, which helps keep them happy and reduces the chance of them leaving.
